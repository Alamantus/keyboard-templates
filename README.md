# minimak-ahk

This is an [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for using the [Minimak keyboard layout](http://www.minimak.org/) without changing hotkey locations.

What this means is that the keys are updated for input but not when using Ctrl or Alt! So keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Shift+P in Sublime Text still work using the regular positions of the keys so your muscle memory doesn't get messed up.

This script also replaces Caps Lock with Backspace, which I think is a great idea. You can still access Caps Lock's functionality by holding Shift while pressing Caps Lock.

## Using different versions of Minimak

The script has each 4-key iteration labeled in the code, so if you want to just use the 4- or 8-key version, comment out the sections you don't want using `;` at the beginning of the line.

At some point, I'd love to learn how to add options to switch these from the right-click menu, but it seems complicated and I don't have the extra time to learn it right now.
