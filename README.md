# minimak-ahk

This is an [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script for using the [Minimak keyboard layout](http://www.minimak.org/) without changing hotkey locations.

What this means is that the keys are updated for input but not when using Ctrl or Alt! So keyboard shortcuts like Ctrl+D or Ctrl+Shift+P in Sublime Text still work using the regular positions of the keys so your muscle memory doesn't get messed up.

This script also replaces Caps Lock with Backspace, which I think is a great idea. You can still access Caps Lock's functionality by holding Shift while pressing Caps Lock.

## Using different versions of Minimak

The script starts with just the 4-key option set, but you can right-click the Tray icon to choose between the 8- and 12-key versions on the fly!

At some point, I'd love to learn how to position the options to switch to be above the Exit option, but I can't figure it out right now.

## Toggling

You can toggle the layout by either right-clicking the Tray menu and choosing "Pause" and "Resume" or by holding Left Alt and pressing Right Alt!
